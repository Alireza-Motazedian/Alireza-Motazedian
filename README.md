Highlights:
---
• **Machine Learning Researcher**: Dealing with noisy time-series data using Deep Learning and traditional Machine Learning algorithms.
I am doing this project for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, UNH.

• **Publication (28)**: [23 published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F4UwOxtfuRZo6IV-JkWMY1BDE1oqBkNR4gWIVVYl71y_zNFg1dgNGPYzcLKxGjf7hi-Uqs1xFfXlxN37DWAINmTkdV7PTO256WwwShdVW8eo9XFRmm9OTpUmdYLNH43G-D3qFeHxjJXraaheJqy2XmFz3g5Fg&user=SEYzORQAAAAJ) (6 Journals & 17 full conference papers), 5 under preparation.

• **Space Science**: As a doctoral project I want to provide a predictive model to investigate the harmful effects of geomagnetic storms.  

• **Nonlinear Optics**: My master’s project investigated the effects of thermal radiation on nonlinear crystals. This project will be continued, and five papers are expected to be published.

• **Recommendations**: Please see my [**recommendations**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alireza-motazedian/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0)
