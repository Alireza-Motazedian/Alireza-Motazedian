Highlights:
---
• **Machine Learning Researcher**: Dealing with noisy time-series data using Deep Learning and traditional Machine Learning algorithms.
I am doing this project for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, UNH.

• **Publication (28)**: 23 published (6 Journals & 17 full conference papers), 5 under preparation.

• **Space Science**: As a doctoral project I want to provide a predictive model to investigate the harmful effects of geomagnetic storms.  

• **Medical project**: As part of my Ph.D. project, I will develop a predictive model to evaluate the effect of plasma technology on cancer cells. 

• **Nonlinear Optics**: My master’s project investigated the effects of thermal radiation on nonlinear crystals. This project will be continued, and five papers are expected to be published.

• **Recommendations**: Please see my [**recommendations**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alireza-motazedian/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0)
